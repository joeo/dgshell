-- Notes ----

All keywords are case insensitive.

The build expression assign the special "last" variable to the
set of fleets that were just built.

The build_statement with an AND SEND TO clause and the
move_statement with multiple destinations distribute the fleets
evenly (by attack power) to the specified destinations.
